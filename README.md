# virtual-world-cpp

The project was carried out during the first year of studies. The aim of the project was to implement a program in the form of a virtual world simulator. In the world, there are simple life forms with different behaviors. In each turn, all organisms existing in the world perform an action appropriate to their type. Some of them move (animal organisms), while others are stationary (plant organisms). In the event of a collision, one of the animal organisms wins by killing or driving away the competitor. The order of movements of organisms in a turn depends on their initiative.
